To run the stack described in the article "Complete Guide to Upload Multiple Files in Node.js using Middleware," you will need to create several files and folders in your project directory. Below, I'll provide you with file names and their purposes:

Create a Project Directory:

You can create a directory for your project. Let's call it file-upload-app.
bash
Copy code
mkdir file-upload-app
cd file-upload-app
Create a package.json File:

To manage your project's dependencies and scripts, create a package.json file. You can generate one by running:
bash
Copy code
npm init -y
Create an Express Application:

You will need a Node.js file to set up your Express application. You can create a server.js file:
bash
Copy code
touch server.js
Install Dependencies:

Install the necessary dependencies mentioned in the article. You can install express, express-fileupload, and other packages using npm:
bash
Copy code
npm install express express-fileupload
Create HTML and Public Folder:

Create an html folder where you can put your HTML files (e.g., index.html) for the file upload form:
bash
Copy code
mkdir html
Create a public folder for static assets (e.g., CSS, JavaScript files) if your project requires it.
bash
Copy code
mkdir public
Create the HTML File:

Create an index.html file inside the html folder for your file upload form:
bash
Copy code
touch html/index.html
Create Middleware and Route Files (if required):

Depending on your project's organization, you may create separate middleware or route files. For example:
bash
Copy code
touch middleware/fileUploadMiddleware.js
touch routes/uploadRoute.js
Create a .gitignore File (optional):

If you plan to use version control with Git, create a .gitignore file to specify files and directories that should not be tracked by Git:
bash
Copy code
touch .gitignore
Initialize a Git Repository (optional):

If you want to use Git for version control, initialize a Git repository:
bash
Copy code
git init
Additional Configuration Files (as needed):

Depending on your project and server configuration, you may need to create configuration files for databases, environment variables, or other settings.
Please note that the specific names and organization of files and folders can vary depending on your project structure and preferences. The above list includes essential files and directories to get you started with a basic file upload application using Node.js and Express.js. You should adapt and expand it based on your project's requirements and organization.

To start a server on an Ubuntu-based system using the command line interface (CLI), you typically need to perform the following steps. Below is a summarized overview of the necessary CLI entries:

Open a Terminal Window: You can open a terminal window by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T or searching for "Terminal" in the application launcher.

Navigate to Your Project Directory (if necessary):

Use the cd command to navigate to the directory where your server application is located. For example:
bash
Copy code
cd /path/to/your/server/app
Start a Node.js Server (for Node.js applications):

If your server is a Node.js application, you can start it by running the appropriate Node.js command. For example, if your main server file is server.js:
bash
Copy code
node server.js
Alternatively, you can use a process manager like pm2 for production-ready Node.js applications:
bash
Copy code
pm2 start server.js
Start an Apache Server (for Apache web server):

If you're using Apache, you can start it using the systemctl command. For example, to start Apache:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start apache2
Start an Nginx Server (for Nginx web server):

If you're using Nginx, you can start it using the systemctl command. For example, to start Nginx:
bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl start nginx
Start a PostgreSQL Server (for PostgreSQL database server):

To start a PostgreSQL server, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
sudo service postgresql start
Start a MySQL Server (for MySQL database server):

To start a MySQL server, you can use the following command:
bash
Copy code
sudo service mysql start
Start a MongoDB Server (for MongoDB database server):

To start a MongoDB server, you can use the mongod command:
bash
Copy code
mongod
Start Other Servers (if applicable):

Depending on the specific server or service you're running, you may have different commands to start them. Refer to the documentation for your server or service for the exact command.
Check the Server Status (optional):

After starting the server, you can check its status to ensure it's running without errors. Use commands like systemctl status (for services) or check your application's logs for Node.js servers.
Access Your Server: Once the server is running, you can access it in a web browser or through other appropriate client applications by entering the server's IP address or domain name along with the relevant port and path.

Remember to run server commands with the necessary permissions, especially when using sudo to start services. The specific commands may vary depending on your server or service configuration.

The program you've provided is a simple web crawler built in Node.js using the crawler library. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how it works:

Import Required Modules:

crawler: A web crawling library for Node.js that allows you to define what to do with the crawled web pages.
readline: A core Node.js module for reading from and writing to the console.
fs: A core Node.js module for interacting with the file system.
path: A core Node.js module for handling and transforming file paths.
valid-url: A library for validating URLs.
Setup Readline Interface:
The program sets up a readline interface to interact with the user through the console, asking for input.

Sanitize URLs:
The sanitizeUrlForFilename function is defined to clean up URLs so that they can be used as filenames. It replaces all non-alphanumeric characters with underscores.

Visited URLs Cache:
A Set object called visitedUrls is created to store URLs that have already been visited to prevent re-crawling the same page.

Start Crawling Function:
The startCrawling function is the main part of the program. It takes a URL and a maximum depth as arguments and starts the crawling process.

Validate URL: It first checks if the provided URL is valid.
Prepare Output File: It generates a unique filename for the output based on the sanitized URL and a timestamp.
Crawl Function: The crawl function is a recursive function that performs the actual crawling. It queues URLs to be visited and processed.
Crawler Queue:
The crawl function uses the crawler library to queue a URL. When the crawler visits a URL, it performs the following:

Error Handling: If there's an error (like a failed HTTP request), it logs the error.
Process HTML Content: If the response is HTML, it logs the size of the content and the URL. It then looks for all a tags (which define hyperlinks) and queues their href attributes for crawling, if they are absolute URLs and within the same origin.
Handle Non-HTML Content: If the content is not HTML, it logs a different message.
Depth Check: It ensures that the crawling does not go beyond the specified maximum depth.
Visited Check: Before queuing new URLs, it checks if they have already been visited.
Crawler Events:

The crawler instance is set up with a drain event, which is called when there are no more URLs to crawl. It logs that the crawling has finished and the results are saved to the output file.
User Input:
The program prompts the user to enter the initial URL and the maximum depth for crawling.

Start the Crawler:
After taking user input, it calls startCrawling with the provided URL and depth, and then closes the readline interface once the crawling is complete.

The program is designed to be a simple recursive crawler that can fetch and log the content of web pages, following links up to a specified depth. It also avoids revisiting pages by keeping track of visited URLs. The output is saved to a text file, and the console logs provide real-time feedback on the crawling process.

To ADD:

Log Start and End of Functions: Log when a function starts and when it ends, along with any important parameters or the result it returns.

Log Error Details: When catching errors, log the full error stack, not just the message, to get more context about where and why the error occurred.

Log Crawler Events: The Crawler library may emit events that can be logged to understand the crawler's state.

Log Retry Attempts: Log when a retry is attempted, including which attempt number it is and how long it will wait before retrying.

Log Rate Adjustments: When the rate adjustment logic triggers, log the new rate and the reason for the adjustment.

Log HTTP Request and Response Details: Log details of the HTTP requests being made and the responses received.

If the crawler is not functioning as expected, there could be several reasons for this behavior. Here are some potential issues and their corresponding fixes:

Initial maxConnections Setting:
The initial maxConnections setting might be too low, causing the crawler to make requests too slowly or not at all if there are immediate errors. Ensure that the initial maxConnections is set to a reasonable number that allows the crawler to start effectively.

Error Handling in retryCrawl:
The retryCrawl function is designed to catch errors and retry, but if it's not correctly handling the errors or the retries are not being queued properly, it could halt the crawling process. Ensure that the retry logic is correctly implemented and that the crawler queues the retries as expected.

Rate Adjustment Logic:
The hysteresis logic might be too aggressive in reducing the maxConnections. If the error threshold is reached quickly, it could reduce the maxConnections to the minimum, effectively stopping the crawler. You may need to adjust the errorThreshold and errorTimeWindow to more appropriate values.

Incorrect Error Code Check:
The code checks for an ECONNRESET error code to adjust the rate. If the errors are not of this type or if they are not being reported with this exact code, the hysteresis mechanism won't trigger. Verify that the error codes are being checked correctly.

Callback Handling:
The done callback needs to be called after each operation, regardless of success or failure, to signal to the crawler that it can proceed with the next task. Ensure that done is being called in all cases.

URL Handling:
If the URLs are not being correctly resolved or sanitized, the crawler might not be able to make the requests. Verify that the URL handling logic is correct and that the URLs being queued are valid.

Crawler Configuration:
The crawler's configuration options might not be set correctly, or some required options might be missing. Review the crawler's documentation to ensure all necessary configuration is in place.

Resource Limitations:
The environment in which the crawler is running might have limitations (like network issues, or restrictions on the number of concurrent connections) that prevent the crawler from operating correctly. Check the system and network resources.

Target Website Restrictions:
The target website might have restrictions in place (like requiring certain headers, cookies, or responding to a user-agent string) that prevent the crawler from accessing the content. Ensure that the crawler is configured to mimic a regular browser request as closely as possible.

Async/Await Misuse:
There might be a misuse of async/await, causing some promises not to resolve correctly, which can halt the crawling process. Ensure that all asynchronous operations are awaited properly.

To diagnose the issue, you can add more detailed logging at various points in the code to see where it might be failing. Once you've identified the specific point of failure, you can apply the appropriate fix.
